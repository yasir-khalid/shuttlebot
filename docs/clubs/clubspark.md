# LTA ClubSpark

49 verified London park tennis venues in `reports/venue-fragments/clubspark.json`, `https://clubspark.lta.org.uk`. Tennis.
Code: `sportscanner/crawlers/parsers/clubspark/`.

## API shape

Base: `GET https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/v0/VenueBooking/{VenueSlug}/GetVenueSessions?resourceID=&startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD&roleId=`

Unauthenticated: no auth headers, cookies, or tokens required for public read access. **A `Referer` header pointing at the venue booking page (`https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/{VenueSlug}/Booking/BookByDate`) is mandatory**:
the identical request without it gets a Cloudflare `403`, with it gets `200` (confirmed live). The crawler sends this header on every request via `referer_for_slug()` in `core/strategy.py`.

A companion endpoint, `GET /v0/VenueBooking/{VenueSlug}/GetSettings`, returns venue metadata (roles, resource categories, timezone, authentication flags) and is used to verify a candidate slug: guessed slugs return HTTP `500` or `404` on `GetSettings`, and login-gated venues return `MustAuthenticate: true`.

Rate limiting: aggressive back-to-back probing trips Cloudflare `429` / `403` challenges for the source IP. The crawler routes through `get_with_proxy_fallback_on_403` in `sportscanner/crawlers/anonymize/proxies.py`, which retries via curl_cffi with a rotating browser TLS fingerprint (`next_impersonate_profile()`) if a direct connection is challenged.

Discovery method: the venue booking HTML page is a thin client-rendered shell with no embedded JSON. The API URL template lives in a shared JS bundle served identically to every venue. The pattern applies to any ClubSpark venue by slug substitution.

### Response shape

```json
{
  "TimeZone": "Europe/London",
  "Resources": [
    {"ID": "...", "Name": "Court 1", "Days": [
      {"Date": "2026-08-20T00:00:00", "Sessions": [
        {"Category": 1000, "Name": "Booking", "StartTime": 450, "EndTime": 480,
         "Interval": 30, "CourtCost": 3.80},
        {"Category": 8000, "Name": "Closed", ...},
        {"Category": 2000, "Name": "Adult Beginners (NTA)", ...}
      ]}
    ]}
  ]
}
```

`StartTime` and `EndTime` are minutes from midnight (converted to `time` in `ClubSparkTennisResponseParserStrategy.parse`). `Category` distinguishes real availability from noise: `1000` = genuinely bookable, `8000` = closed, `2000` = coaching/programmed session. Only `1000` rows are emitted as slots.

## Why this bypasses BaseCrawler default fetch loop

`GetVenueSessions` takes a `startDate`/`endDate` range and returns every day in between in one call, unlike the venue x single-date shape `BaseCrawler` default loop assumes. `ClubSparkTennisCrawler` overrides `ScraperCoroutines` to issue one request per venue covering `min(dates)..max(dates)`, rather than one request per venue per date.

## Cloudflare bot management

Responses set a `__cf_bm` cookie. The crawler uses `get_with_proxy_fallback_on_403` in `sportscanner/crawlers/anonymize/proxies.py` to transparently fall back to curl_cffi requests with a rotating browser TLS fingerprint whenever a direct IP is challenged with 403 or 429.

### Status: all 49 venues 403 on every run (September 2026)

Confirmed live via full CI logs: **every one of the 49 ClubSpark venues** 403s on every date, every run, even after every TLS-impersonation profile in `get_with_proxy_fallback_on_403` is exhausted — this is a total provider outage from GitHub Actions, not "a handful of venues."

### FlareSolverr fallback - tried, does not help from the runner IP

`anonymize/flaresolverr.py` adds a real-headless-browser fallback (`flaresolverr/flaresolverr`) to `get_with_proxy_fallback_on_403`, gated behind `FLARESOLVERR_URL` (true no-op when unset). This looked promising from a residential IP - a real browser gets issued a `cf_clearance` cookie after solving Cloudflare's JS challenge, proving it's a solvable challenge in principle, not a flat network block.

**But tested live against the actual GitHub Actions runner IP (2026-09-14), it made no difference: all 39 ClubSpark venues reached before the test run was cancelled still failed with `exhausted direct + TLS-impersonation + FlareSolverr attempts`.** Cloudflare's bot-management scoring for this runner IP range is apparently strict enough to present something even a real headless browser can't auto-solve (most likely an interactive challenge, not the JS-only proof-of-work a residential IP gets) - IP reputation still gates the outcome even when JS execution is genuine. The CI sidecar wiring was reverted for this reason (pure latency/complexity cost with zero payoff); the client code stays as an inert capability (`FLARESOLVERR_URL` unset in production) in case it's useful again alongside a non-datacenter egress IP for the FlareSolverr container itself.

No known free/open-source technique gets past this. The remaining levers are the same non-free ones as Playtomic's always-blocked venues (see `playtomic.md`): a residential-IP egress for the whole request (proxy or self-hosted runner), not a client-side trick.

## Login-Gated Booking Pages (booking_url fallback)

Six of the 49 tracked venues server-side redirect their `/Booking/BookByDate`
page to LTA Play login (`.../{slug}/Booking/LTAPlayLogin`) instead of showing
the availability calendar anonymously: `RavenscourtPark`, `SouthParkFulham`,
`HurlinghamPark`, `BrockwellPark`, `TelegraphHill`, `LytteltonPlayingFields`.
Confirmed venue by venue across all 49 venues in August 2026 via curl_cffi
chrome impersonation; plain curl sees the same 302, so this is ClubSpark's own
per-council routing configuration, not a Cloudflare artifact. Their
`GetSettings` still reports `MustAuthenticate: false` and their underlying
`GetVenueSessions` JSON API still serves real availability anonymously, so
they remain in scope: only the deep link is gated.

For these six, `booking_url_for_slug()` in `core/strategy.py` points
`booking_url` at the venue's public home page (`/{slug}`), which loads fine
without an account and links out to booking, rather than dumping a user on an
LTA Play registration screen under this venue's name.

## Dropped and Login-Gated Venues

The following candidates were investigated and excluded per the public availability scope rule:

- `GreenwichPark` (Greenwich Park Tennis Courts): viewing redirects to `auth.clubspark.uk` login.
- `TannerStreetPark` (Tanner Street Park, Southwark): `MustAuthenticate: true` on settings endpoint.
- `SpringfieldPark` (Springfield Park, Hackney): `MustAuthenticate: true` on settings endpoint.
- `HammersmithPark`, `ShoreditchPark`: viewing redirects to `auth.clubspark.uk` login.
- `HackneyTennis` and `TennisInSouthwark`: borough scheme shells with 0 court resources.
- `CityOfLondonTennis`: shell with 0 court resources.
- `CherryTreeWood` (Barnet): serves 404 / NotFound.

## Verification Results

End-to-end test execution of `ClubSparkTennisCrawler._crawl_async` across all 49 venues for a 3-day window yielded 2,272 parsed `UnifiedParserSchema` slots with realistic prices ranging from free community slots (£0.00) to standard £4.00-£15.00 rates. All postcodes and coordinates have been validated with Postcodes.io.
