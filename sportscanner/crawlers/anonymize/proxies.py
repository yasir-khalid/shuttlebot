# Browser TLS fingerprints used for the free WAF retry stage. Playtomic, Matchi
# and ClubSpark sit behind Cloudflare-style bot checks that score the TLS
# handshake: Python's httpx/ssl handshake fails from datacenter IPs (GitHub
# Actions runners) with an immediate 403 even when the same request succeeds
# from residential IPs. curl_cffi replays a genuine browser handshake, which is
# the same fix CitySport needed (see docs/clubs/citysport.md).
#
# Rotated rather than fixed on one profile: "chrome124" is the default
# impersonate target in nearly every curl_cffi tutorial/example, so it is a
# well-known JA3/JA4 hash to WAF operators specifically because it is so
# common in the scraping community - a WAF can blocklist that one fingerprint
# without touching real Chrome traffic (real Chrome moved past v124 in mid
# 2024). Cycling through several current, less-fingerprinted browsers gives
# each retry attempt a materially different handshake instead of hammering
# the same one twice.

    Retry chain:
    1. Direct httpx request.
    2. curl_cffi, cycling through `_IMPERSONATE_PROFILES` - each retry replays a
       different genuine browser TLS handshake. Cloudflare-style WAFs
       (Playtomic, Matchi, ClubSpark) score the handshake itself, and httpx's
       Python-ssl handshake is an automatic fail from datacenter IPs such as
       GitHub Actions runners even when the target IP is not blocklisted. Same
       fix CitySport needed (docs/clubs/citysport.md). Rotating profiles also
       covers the case where one specific fingerprint (not just "any
       non-browser TLS handshake") has itself been blocklisted.

    A 403 or 429 through a direct connection can mean this host's IP is blocklisted or
    rate-limited by Cloudflare / WAF for this specific target.

    Returns the successful response (httpx or curl_cffi - both expose .json() /
    .text / .status_code), or `None` if every impersonation retry also failed
