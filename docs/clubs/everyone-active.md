# Everyone Active

15 venues (12 badminton, 6 squash, 3 offering both), `https://www.everyoneactive.com/`. Badminton and Squash.
Code: `sportscanner/crawlers/parsers/everyoneactive/`.

## API shape

Per-venue hardcoded `activityId` strings in dict literals:
- Badminton: `EveryoneActiveBadmintonRequestStrategy.generate_request_details`
- Squash: `EveryoneActiveSquashRequestStrategy.generate_request_details`

Dates are passed as UTC timestamp ranges (`get_utc_timestamps(fetch_date)` in `everyoneactive/core/utils.py`), not a plain date string.

Endpoints:
- Availability: `GET https://caching.everyoneactive.com/aws/api/activity/availability?toUTC={to_utc}&activityId={activityId}&fromUTC={from_utc}&locale=en_GB`
- Activity discovery: `GET https://caching.everyoneactive.com/aws/api/activity/list`
- Header for both: `AuthenticationKey: M0bi1eProB00king$`

The discovery endpoint returns all activity types across all centres in a single JSON payload (`types[].sites[].acts[]`). Filter by activity name (such as "Squash 45 Min") and site name to retrieve the `activityId` and duration for any venue.

## Squash Activity Identifiers

Squash sessions run for 45 minutes. The availability response does not include pricing, so slots are stamped with `price="N/A"`.

## WAF and TLS-fingerprint Rotation

`caching.everyoneactive.com` uses a CDN/WAF layer that blocks requests from GitHub Actions runner IP ranges (residential/local IP connections succeed directly).

The paid rotating-proxy pool that used to sit in front of this was removed in August 2026 (see `anonymize/proxies.py`) — its exits were blocklisted by the same WAF as the runner range, so it was burning budget for no benefit. `EveryoneActiveCrawler._fetch_with_retry` now retries entirely through `curl_cffi`, cycling through `next_impersonate_profile()`'s rotation (`chrome136`, `safari180`, `firefox135`, `chrome124`) on each of its up to 5 attempts per request, so every retry presents a materially different TLS handshake rather than repeating the same one (or, previously, a plain-httpx retry with no fingerprint at all — which had no chance of getting past a WAF that already scored the handshake, not just the IP).

## Status (August 2026)

Verified live:
- Badminton: 12 venues verified.
- Squash: 6 London venues verified (155 slots returned across 6 centres on test date, genuine mixed availability).
