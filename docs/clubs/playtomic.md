# Playtomic

48 London and Greater London venues: padel, tennis, pickleball.
`https://playtomic.com`.
Code: `sportscanner/crawlers/parsers/playtomic/`.

## API shape

Base: `GET https://playtomic.com/api/clubs/availability?tenant_id={uuid}&date=YYYY-MM-DD&sport_id={sport}`

`tenant_id` is a stable UUID assigned once when a club registers on Playtomic and never changes, hardcoded in `SLUG_TO_TENANT_ID` (`playtomic/core/strategy.py`). To find a new venue's `tenant_id`: inspect the club's public page network requests or HTML payload.

Response is a flat JSON array of per-court resources, aggregated by `(start_time, duration)` across courts in `_resources_to_unified()`. `spaces` reflects how many courts are bookable at that exact slot, not a single court's availability.

Booking URLs need a separate slug: the API's `tenant_id`/slug (stored as `venue.slug` in `venues.json`) does not always match the public website URL. Some tenant slugs have trailing dashes or different naming conventions from `playtomic.com/clubs/{slug}`. `_BOOKING_SLUG_OVERRIDES` maps the API slug to the correct public slug; a value of `None` means no working public page exists for that venue at all.

**This provider does not use `BaseCrawler`'s per-venue request loop.** Like Matchi, Playtomic's availability API is queried by `tenant_id` param rather than a per-venue URL path, so Playtomic crawlers override `ScraperCoroutines` directly and drive `PlaytomicAvailabilityFetcher.fetch_venue_date()` with bounded concurrency via `asyncio.Semaphore`.

## WAF and Proxy Fallback

Playtomic availability API uses CloudFront WAF rate limiting and TLS fingerprint validation. Requests carry browser headers (`_HEADERS` in `playtomic/core/strategy.py`). On HTTP 403 or 429 status codes, `fetch_venue_date()` retries through `get_with_proxy_fallback_on_403()` in `crawlers/anonymize/proxies.py`, which retries direct httpx first, then curl_cffi, cycling through `next_impersonate_profile()`'s rotation (`chrome136`, `safari180`, `firefox135`, `chrome124`) once per remaining attempt. This is what usually rescues GitHub Actions runs (Python's ssl handshake is an automatic WAF fail from datacenter IPs).

A small number of specific venues/tenants (confirmed live: Kensington Tennis Club venues, Tennis England Club, on some runs) still exhaust every rotation profile and get 403 on every date in a run, even though other Playtomic venues succeed in the same run from the same runner IP. That points at a per-tenant WAF rule (rate-based or bot-score) rather than a purely IP- or fingerprint-based block — TLS impersonation can't fix a rule that specifically penalizes traffic to that URL/tenant_id combination regardless of handshake. If this keeps recurring for the same venues, the next lever to pull is request pacing/concurrency for just those tenant_ids, not more fingerprint variety.

## Tennis

Identical API and response shape to padel: `sport_id=TENNIS`. Response schema (`PlaytomicResource`/`PlaytomicSlot`, `playtomic/core/schema.py`) is shared across all sports.

`PlaytomicTennisCrawler` (`playtomic/tennis/scraper.py`) reuses the shared `SLUG_TO_TENANT_ID` map (tenant_id identifies the club, not the sport) and `PlaytomicAvailabilityFetcher` configured with `sport_id=TENNIS_SPORT_ID, category="Tennis"`.
